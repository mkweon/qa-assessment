# QA Assignment
The objective of this assignment is to test your ability to create a suite of tests that validates some functionality of an API service and validates the data.

## How to access the API service
 * Clone this repo to your local environment, and run the following commands (make sure any version of node is installed in your machine)
```
npm install json-server
npm start
```
 * Once npm is running, you should be able to access API endpoints such as http://localhost:3000/users
